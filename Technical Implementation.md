Technical implementation
------------------------

In terms of technical implementation, the decentralized web of trust reputation system relies on several key features.

Claims made by auditors and checking tools are recorded on a smart contract blockchain, as this provides the necessary infrastructure for storing and accessing this information. While a blockchain is not strictly necessary for the DWoTR system, it does offer several benefits, such as the ability to easily verify claims against the underlying database if needed. Additionally, using a blockchain allows smart contracts to take advantage of trust claims to a limited degree natively.

The DWoTR system also utilizes a graph database to aggregate the trust claims issued and enable queries against the network. Both centralized and decentralized versions of a graph database can be used, though a centralized version may be more practical for most needs as the results can be easily verified against the blockchain database if necessary.

Finally, the DWoTR system provides both a browser interface and an API for querying the graph database and conducting larger searches against the network. These tools allow users and developers to easily access and utilize the information contained within the DWoTR system.

Overall, the technical implementation of the decentralized web of trust reputation system is designed to provide users with a simple and effective way to verify the security and legitimacy of smart contracts. By leveraging the infrastructure of a smart contract blockchain and utilizing a graph database and user-friendly interfaces, the DWoTR system can help to build trust and confidence in the blockchain ecosystem.
