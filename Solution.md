The Decentralized web of trust reputation system, or DWoTR, works by allowing auditors and contract checking tools to register their claims that they have audited a particular contract on the blockchain. This information is then made available to other users in the network, who can leverage these claims in order to make more informed decisions about the contracts they are considering using.

One of the key benefits of the DWoTR system is that it does not attempt to audit contracts itself, but rather relies on the claims of trusted auditors and checking tools. This allows for a decentralized and distributed approach to contract verification, rather than relying on a single central authority.

One of the key features of the decentralized web of trust reputation system is that the claims made by auditors and checking tools are recorded on the blockchain and made available to all users. This allows for a high level of transparency and accessibility, as users can easily access and review the claims made by auditors.

In addition to the other benefits of the decentralized web of trust reputation system, it also allows users to leverage multiple degrees of trusted people, which greatly increases the chances of a useful result.

By connecting users in a decentralized network, the DWoTR system allows users to build their own personal network of trust based on the claims of auditors and checking tools that they trust. This allows for a more personalized and effective approach to contract verification, as users can rely on the claims of those that they know and trust.

Furthermore, by leveraging multiple degrees of trusted people, users can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the contracts they are considering using. Rather than relying on the claims of a single auditor or checking tool, users can draw on the collective knowledge and experience of their entire network of trust.

In addition to simply recording the claims, the DWoTR system also aggregates these claims into a network of trust. This network can be queried by browser or API calls, allowing users and developers to easily access and utilize the information contained within.

One way in which this network of trust can be used is by wallet providers, who can implement the DWoTR API in order to provide their users with warnings before submitting a transaction. This can help to protect users from potentially fraudulent or vulnerable contracts, as they will be alerted to any issues before completing the transaction.

Another advantage of the decentralized web of trust reputation system is that it provides incentives for auditors and others to record their findings on the system. By doing so, they can help out other users and increase their own reputation within the network.

A high reputation score within the DWoTR system can be a valuable asset, as it can open up new opportunities for those who hold it. For auditors and checking tools, a high reputation score can lead to more business and greater credibility within the community.

Furthermore, recording findings on the DWoTR system can be a way for individuals to contribute to the broader community and help to build a more secure and trustworthy blockchain ecosystem. By sharing their knowledge and experience, they can help to protect others from the risks posed by unaudited and potentially vulnerable smart contracts.

The DWoTR system is designed to be decentralized, and it is in this spirit that users are able to choose the auditors and checking tools they trust. This allows for a more distributed and democratic approach to contract verification, rather than relying on a single central authority.

It is important to note that while the decentralized web of trust reputation system has the potential to greatly improve the security and trustworthiness of the blockchain ecosystem, it is not a perfect solution. As with any technology, there are limitations and potential risks to consider.

One of the advantages of the decentralized web of trust reputation system is that it is resistant to bots and spam attacks. This is because the claims made by auditors and checking tools within the system need to be trusted by other good actors in order to be relevant.

If some actors are identified as bad actors, they can quickly be distrusted by the community and effectively cut off from most users who might otherwise have been affected by their claims. This helps to protect the integrity of the system and prevent spam and bot attacks from compromising the network.

One potential limitation is the subjectivity of the reputation scores within the DWoTR system. As these scores are based on the subjective claims of auditors and checking tools, they may not necessarily reflect the objective quality of a particular contract. Users should be aware of this and carefully consider the reputation of the sources they rely on when making decisions about contracts.

Additionally, there is the risk of bad actors attempting to manipulate the DWoTR system by making false or fraudulent claims. While the decentralized nature of the system can help to mitigate this risk, it is still important for users to exercise caution and due diligence when utilizing the system.

It is important to note that no solution will be able to completely eliminate the risk of fraud, and users should always be cautious and vigilant when interacting with unfamiliar individuals or contracts. However, by leveraging the tools and resources available, users can greatly reduce their risk of falling victim to scams and frauds.

Despite these limitations, the decentralized web of trust reputation system remains a promising solution to the problem of unaudited and potentially vulnerable smart contracts. By providing a platform for auditors and checking tools to register their claims, and allowing users to build their own networks of trust, the DWoTR system can help to build trust and confidence in the blockchain ecosystem.

Conclusion
----------
Overall, the decentralized web of trust reputation system offers a promising solution to the problem of unaudited and potentially vulnerable smart contracts. By providing a platform for auditors and checking tools to register their claims, and allowing users to access and utilize this information through browser or API calls, the DWoTR system can help to build trust and confidence in the blockchain ecosystem.
The ability of the DWoTR system to enable users to leverage multiple degrees of trusted people is a significant advantage in terms of building trust and confidence in the blockchain ecosystem. By allowing users to build their own personal networks of trust, the DWoTR system can help to mitigate the risks posed by unaudited and potentially vulnerable smart contracts.
The incentives provided by the DWoTR system encourage auditors and others to record their findings and contribute to the network, which helps to build trust and confidence in the blockchain ecosystem. By providing these incentives, the DWoTR system can help to create a more secure and transparent environment for all users.
