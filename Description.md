## Description

The DWoTR (Decentralized Web of Trust Reputation) system is a decentralized trust network that aims to whitelist smart contracts, addresses, and websites in the web3 environment. The system leverages the trust of the community to provide a secure and reliable method for verifying the authenticity and integrity of smart contracts.

The way it works is that members of the community can act as validators by reviewing and auditing smart contracts, addresses, and websites. They can then attest to the validity and security of these entities, and their attestation is recorded on the blockchain. This creates a decentralized trust network where the trustworthiness of an entity is determined by the collective trust of the community.

From a user perspective, when accessing a smart contract or website through a wallet that has integrated the DWoTR system, the wallet will check the trustworthiness of the entity by checking if it has been previously vetted by the community. If the entity has been flagged as malicious or untrustworthy, the wallet will display a warning to the user. This allows users to make informed decisions about interacting with a particular smart contract or website, and can help protect them from scams, rugs, and bugs that are prevalent in the web3 environment.

The DWoTR system aims to improve the security and trustworthiness of the web3 ecosystem by providing a decentralized, community-driven validation system that is easy to use and can be integrated into existing web3 wallets. By enabling users to make more informed decisions about the smart contracts and websites they interact with, the DWoTR system aims to promote a safer and more trustworthy web3 environment for all users.
