## Description

The DWoTR (Decentralized Web of Trust Reputation) system is a decentralized trust network that aims to whitelist smart contracts, addresses, and websites in the web3 environment. The system leverages the trust of the community to provide a secure and reliable method for verifying the authenticity and integrity of smart contracts.

The way it works is that members of the community can act as validators by reviewing and auditing smart contracts, addresses, and websites. They can then attest to the validity and security of these entities, and their attestation is recorded on the blockchain. This creates a decentralized trust network where the trustworthiness of an entity is determined by the collective trust of the community.

From a user perspective, when accessing a smart contract or website through a wallet that has integrated the DWoTR system, the wallet will check the trustworthiness of the entity by checking if it has been previously vetted by the community. If the entity has been flagged as malicious or untrustworthy, the wallet will display a warning to the user. This allows users to make informed decisions about interacting with a particular smart contract or website, and can help protect them from scams, rugs, and bugs that are prevalent in the web3 environment.

The DWoTR system is different from other contract validation sites in that it uses the trust of the community from a personal perspective to audit and validate smart contracts, addresses, and websites. It aggregates trust, audits and verifications from the community rather than relying on centralized authorities to provide these services. This approach allows web3 wallet providers to offer validation services to their users without the need to manage and maintain the trust validation process themselves.

A blockchain is used to store trust data that allows for anyone to read and access the data, enabling them to independently aggregate the results and make their own trust evaluations. By leveraging the immutability and transparency of the blockchain, ensures that the trust data is tamper-proof and can be easily verified by all parties involved. This creates a decentralized trust network that is not controlled by any single entity, making it more robust and resistant to manipulation. 

By utilizing a graph database to store trust data from the blockchain, enables for fast and efficient lookup and aggregation of data. By leveraging this technology, it can provide a personal perspective on the trustworthiness of smart contracts, addresses, and websites, allowing users to make informed decisions. The graph service offers a free version and paid options for more in-depth results, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

The DWoTR system aims to improve the security and trustworthiness of the web3 ecosystem by providing a decentralized, community-driven validation system that is easy to use and can be integrated into existing web3 wallets. By enabling users to make more informed decisions about the smart contracts and websites they interact with, the DWoTR system aims to promote a safer and more trustworthy web3 environment for all users.
